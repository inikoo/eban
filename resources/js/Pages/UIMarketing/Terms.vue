    IMPORTANT VAT CHANGES TO VAT RULES (valid from 01.08.2021)

    From 1st July 2021, the EU VAT rules on cross-border e-commerce activities have changed. The rationale for these changes is to overcome the barriers to cross-border online sales.With the introduction of the new rules, from the 6th August 2021 we are applying for our customers without valid VAT number, the VAT of the EU Member State of final arrival of the goods. There are no changes for customers in EU Member State who have valid VAT Number. We would like to take this opportunity to remind you to check your AW Artisan Account and see if your VAT number and rest of the company details are up to date. For more information, please visit European Union website.



    Some products carry a volume/ Gold Reward discount. These products are marked as such on their respective product pages. If a discount is advertised on a product page, it corresponds to that particular product (family code) only. The volume/ Gold Reward discount are the same discount based on different terms – these are not two discouts and they cannot be combined.

    On occasion we may send out email and/or mail special offers/ voucher codes. Each such offer will have its own terms and conditions and these will be specified within the offer. These offers will be applied to orders compliant with the specified terms and conditions only.

    The discounts are displayed and calculated in the shopping cart.



    If a buyer wishes to apply for an additional discount, we require a minimum purchase of €500+VAT of one particular item (not a variety across a family code) to be made. We will then consider offering an additional discount based on the overall quantity of purchased product code. If a discount is offered, we require for the payment to be made in one transaction (unless we require a deposit, then we will ask for 20% of the overall value to be paid in advance) and the order to be delivered in full to one address specified by the buyer. All special discount offers are valid for 30 days only from the issue date.

    We reserve the right to request a 20% non-refundable deposit for any special orders placed with us. The delivery time-scales for special orders are agreed individually at the point of sale and can be different to the standard delivery time-scales.

    If a buyer cancels an order after it has been confirmed and the deposit has been paid, AW Artisan S.L.  reserves the right not to refund the deposit as it is required to cover the administration costs.



    4. Orders



    Please note, that we have a minimum order value of 50€ before carriage and VAT.

    Orders below this threshold will incur 5€ + VAT small order charge, except gold reward customers. This applies to all orders placed with AW Artisan, regardless of how the order is submitted

If special instructions are provided post-dispatch of the order, we cannot guarantee the courier will receive them in time, which may delay the delivery.

The delivery is not timed, however the freight company usually will telephone an hour before the delivery is to take place. If the pallet arrives at the destination and no-one is there, the driver will contact the number provided by the customer and usually wait for around 10 minutes If they cannot reach the customer, they will contact AW Artisan to advise us of this.
